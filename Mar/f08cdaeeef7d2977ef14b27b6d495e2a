This year's iteration will bring together African partners and Allied nations in a classroom setting to discuss topics related to peacekeeping operations. This exercise will include structured vignettes and practical applications related to transitioning AMISOM to a Somali-led mission. The end goal of JA17 is to increase interoperability, to further relationships with partners in the region, and to build upon the plan for a more robust exercise for JA18.



Once the exercise is complete, all exercise participants will return to their home countries and stations.
