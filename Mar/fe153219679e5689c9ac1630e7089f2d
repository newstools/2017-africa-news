BRUSSELS, Belgium, March 17, 2017/APO/ --
                                                
                        Belgium is deeply concerned with the disappearance of two members of the UN Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and of four Congolese support staff, last weekend in Kasai Central province. Five days after they were reported missing, Belgium calls on the Congolese authorities to use all possible means, with the support of MONUSCO, to find these persons.
 

Belgium expresses its appreciation for the Group of Experts for the important monitoring and investigation work carried out under difficult conditions and welcomes the work of the experts Michael Sharp and Zaida Catalán in carrying out their United Nations Security Council mandate. Their disappearance is a serious blow to the efforts of the international community to bring back peace and stability in the DRC.
 
Belgium is deeply concerned about the deteriorating security situation in the DRC, particularly in the Kasai region. There are reports of massive violations of human rights and humanitarian law in the region, including the disproportionate use of force, arbitrary executions and the discovery of mass graves. Belgium pleads, together with its European partners, for an international and independent investigation, in addition to and in support of national efforts.
