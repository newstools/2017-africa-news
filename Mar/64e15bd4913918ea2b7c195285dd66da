                        The head of the UN peacekeeping mission in South Sudan, David Shearer, has told the African Union in Addis Ababa that the situation in the country continues to deteriorate and generate profound human suffering in which local and ethnic divisions have been exploited for political ends.



Addressing an AU Peace and Security Council meeting on South Sudan on Friday in Addis Ababa, Mr Shearer said that “conflict is apparent across the country.”

In recent weeks there has been an escalation of fighting in Equatoria and Upper Nile regions. Both have led to significant and additional displacement of civilians.

Meanwhile, he added that new armed groups and actors are emerging leaving South Sudan deeply divided. He said a “circuit breaker is desperately needed.”

He reiterated that access denials to both humanitarian organisations and the UN mission, UNMISS, even in the face of such enormous suffering are continuing.

And he described as “alarming” the lack of any response from South Sudanese leaders of all sides to the plight of their people.

He urged the international community to speak with one voice, to help create the political will for the parties to cease hostilities and build peace.

“Standing together is the only way to move forward,” he said.
