NAIROBI, Kenya, September 5, 2017/APO/ --
                                                
                        The Kenyan Supreme Court's ordering of a re-run of the Presidential elections is a strong demonstration of the independence of the Kenyan judiciary and the strength of national democracy. The appeal procedure is in line with the democratic process as prescribed in the Constitution of Kenya.



At this important time, the court decision requires all political forces and the Kenyan people to act with the highest sense of responsibility and full respect for the rule of law and the Constitution. 

All institutions involved in the re-run of the elections should now be given the space to continue to work independently and start preparing for new transparent, credible, inclusive and peaceful elections, fulfilling all the requirements of the Constitution and the election law. A peaceful election campaign will require political leaders to use their authority.

The EU is continuing to support Kenya in these efforts. The EU Election Observation Mission will stay in the country until the completion of the electoral process.

Kenya is a key partner for the European Union in the region and we are committed to strengthening our relationship further after the elections.
