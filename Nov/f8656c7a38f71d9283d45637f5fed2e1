KAMPALA, Uganda, November 13, 2017/APO Group/ --
                                                
                        WHAT: The Government of Uganda will launch its first-ever National Child Participation Strategy, which provides direction for key stakeholders – families, communities, parents, leaders, teachers, policy makers, etc -  to promote meaningful child participation at all levels of Ugandan society.



WHEN: Wednesday, 15 November 2017 from 10:00am to 12:00noon

WHERE: Kitante Primary School, Kampala

WHO: Hon. Florence Nakiwala Kiyingi, Minister of State for Youth and Children Affairs, Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development

WHY: While the right for children to participate is clearly articulated in international Conventions such as the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), to which Uganda is a signatory, as well as in several regional and national legal frameworks, children in Uganda face many challenges in exercising this fundamental right.

The Strategy therefore aims to provide an enabling environment for children to voice their views on issues affecting their lives, for children to be recognized as key stakeholders, and for children’s issues to be addressed in Uganda’s plans, programmes and services.
