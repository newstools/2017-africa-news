After Zimbabwe’s vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwa’s powers were severely diminished following a recent cabinet reshuffle, it appeared that he was being slowly edged out. But two days later, he was abruptly fired by President Robert Mugabe.

The coming weeks will confirm or dispel the many legends around Mnangagwa and Zimbabwe’s succession race.

This View on Africa is presented by Derek Matyszak, an ISS senior research consultant based in Harare. He will consider the impact of Mnangagwa’s firing on the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front and the country’s immediate political future.
