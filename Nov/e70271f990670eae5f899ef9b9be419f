CAPE TOWN, South Africa, November 9, 2017/APO Group/ --
                                                
                        A joint meeting of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (SCOPA) and the Portfolio Committee on Social Development today agreed to receive a follow-up briefing from the Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) on Tuesday, 21 November 2017 on progress in addressing the finalisation of the appointment of an entity that will pay social grants after the expiry of the current contract with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) on March 2018.





The Joint Committee welcomed the statement presented by the IMC on the decision it has taken to fast-track the introduction of an integrated payment system, which will be provided by government through a partnership between the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) and the South African Post Office (SAPO). The Joint Committee is interested to see how this partnership will resolve this issue timeously.



The Joint Committee is also interested to see what the cooperation agreements between Sassa and SAPO entail. It is in the interests of South Africans for this process to be fast-tracked. The Joint Committee has decided that it will no longer engage with Sassa and SAPO officials, but only with the IMC.
