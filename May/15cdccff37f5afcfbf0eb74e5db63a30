We remain deeply concerned about the safety and wellbeing of the schoolgirls and other victims still in captivity.

We appeal to all Nigerians, including the families and local communities of the liberated girls, to fully embrace them and provide all necessary support to ensure their reintegration into society. We also urge the international community to continue supporting the Government of Nigeria in its efforts to ensure the release, rehabilitation and reintegration of all Boko Haram victims.

We also call for the provision of urgent financial support to prevent the worsening of the food security situation in the northeast of Nigeria and other parts of the Lake Chad Basin, and reiterate the continued commitment of the United Nations in this regard.
