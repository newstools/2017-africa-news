                        Hospitals in Libya are suffering from a shortage of medical supplies even as they see an increase in patients, leading the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to donate a new round of needed medicines and material to three facilities across the country. 



Al Wahda hospital in Derna, Al Jalaa Trauma Hospital in Benghazi and the polyclinic in Ajeelat have all benefitted from a donation of supplies over the last two weeks.

"Libya’s medical professionals have been struggling to help patients in need due to a lack of supplies,” said Karl Mattli, the head of delegation for the ICRC in Libya. “Doctors performing lifesaving procedures must have the material they need to do their work.”

The ICRC has delivered 60 tons of essential medical supplies to more than 30 hospitals and health facilities across Libya this year amid a difficult economic period. The donated items include anesthesia, dressings, drugs, injection material, sterilization items, surgical materials and sutures. 

The recent delivery of medical supplies to Al Wahda hospital in Derna was carried out with the permission of the parties to the conflict. It is commendable that medical supplies are allowed to cross conflict areas.

Still, the ICRC is highly concerned by the disruption of public services and the deterioration of infrastructure in Libya due to a lack of maintenance and attention. 

“The areas of public health, sanitation and clean water are deteriorating, impacting the living conditions of residents in Libya,” said Mattli. “This has deeply worrying consequences for community health. We hope to see these public resources maintained to ensure society at large remains safe and healthy.”
