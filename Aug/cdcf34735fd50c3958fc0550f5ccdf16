The Secretary-General encourages the Cameroonian authorities to pursue their efforts to address the grievances of the Anglophone community and promote measures of national reconciliation in order to find a durable solution to the crisis. The Secretary-General reiterates the readiness of the United Nations to continue to support such efforts.
