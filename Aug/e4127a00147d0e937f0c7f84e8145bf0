                        The end of July 2017 saw the official finalisation of the Namibian-German Special Initiative (NGSIP) development program which had been managed by the National Planning Commission NPC. The last so called “deliveries” of successful individual projects are also in full swing. 







German Ambassador Christian Schlaga and Ned Sibeya, Deputy Chief, National Development Advice, handed over a campsite and a SME (Small and Medium Enterprise) Center to the Koes Village Council.  





Sibeya pointed out that with the handing over of the projects, the responsibility for the upkeep and maintenance of the buildings would now also shift. He expressed his hope that the community would work with commitment and innovation to further expand the facilities. 





Also within the framework of the Namibian-German Special Initiative (NGSIP). Deputy Minister Lucia Iipumbu and the Councillor for Development Cooperation at the German Embassy, Christian Grün, also handed over the new boarding accommodation for learners in Seringkop on 21 August. The Special Adviser to the Governor of Kunene, Katuutire Kaura, emphasized the impressive scope of educational projects of the Namibian-German Special Initiative in the Kunene region, especially in very remote areas.
