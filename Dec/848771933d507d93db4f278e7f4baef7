                        This year, United Nations Volunteers in Egypt have collaborated with the Egyptian Red Crescent (ERC) in implementing a joint 3-day event from the 5th to the 7th of December. This event aims to shed light on how #VolunteersActFirst to support their communities and reinforce joint action on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The launch event took place on the 5th of December at ERC premises, attended by the Under-Secretary General of ERC, Dr. Nehal Hefny, and the UN Resident Coordinator Mr. Richard Dictus, which has been followed by two days of action promoting volunteerism and providing first aid training in various locations around Cairo. A double-decker bus that is decorated with the slogan, "Volunteers Act First" is a prime symbol for the event as it has been taking a number of ERC and UN Volunteers to these locations, raising awareness and interest in the volunteerism campaign and SDGs along the way.

The United Nations Volunteers (UNV) Executive Coordinator, Mr. Olivier Adam, stated on the occasion of International Volunteer Day, “Here, everywhere, volunteers help prevent the worst effects of crisis, bringing much-needed relief to those who suffer the most. On International Volunteer Day, let us recognize the relentless efforts of volunteers who answer calls in times of need for the common dignity of all”. This quote captures the essence of the celebration of the work and efforts of volunteers across all communities.
