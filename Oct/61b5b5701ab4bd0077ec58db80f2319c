                        In the early hours of Monday morning, MONUSCO repelled an attack by suspected Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) on a MONUSCO position in Mamundioma, North Kivu province, during which the Mission sustained casualties.

This follows an attack in the same region earlier on Sunday where presumed ADF ambushed a convoy of civilians on motorbikes on the road between Kamango and Mbau. According to initial reports, up to 20 civilians were killed.



“I strongly condemn these cowardly attacks targeting the civilian population and United Nations peacekeepers in the Beni area”, said the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Maman Sidikou.

“This region has seen more than enough violence already, including horrific massacres of innocent civilians. I reiterate to all these armed groups who continue to threaten and kill civilians, MONUSCO will respond, and it will respond strongly”, added Sidikou.

MONUSCO has immediately deployed reinforcements, including a Quick Reaction Force and attack helicopters, to secure the location, ensure freedom of movement for the civilian population as well as protect the nearby villages of Kamango and Mbau from further attacks and restrict the movement and activities of armed group.
