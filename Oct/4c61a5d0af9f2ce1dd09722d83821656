GENEVA, Switzerland, October 10, 2017/APO/ --
                                                
                        A UN human rights expert has praised the US decision to lift sanctions against Sudan after two decades of enforcement.



The Special Rapporteur on the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights, Idriss Jazairy, said the welcome decision taken by the US Administration on 6 October 2017 followed “sustained positive action by the Government of Sudan”, and demonstrated a worthy commitment to dialogue.
                            The sanctions have been enforced by all Sudan’s trading partners and I believe they have had a major effect on vulnerable population groups
                        

“The sanctions have been enforced by all Sudan’s trading partners and I believe they have had a major effect on vulnerable population groups,” said Mr. Jazairy.

Mr. Jazairy and the UN Independent Expert on Sudan, Mr. Aristide Nononsi, have worked behind the scenes over the past 16 months to bring about conditions leading to the decision.  

The Obama administration started the process of lifting the sanctions, and it was agreed that the final decision would be taken by the Trump administration if the Government of Sudan was judged to have sustained the “positive path” which gave rise to the initial US move.  

“The US decision opens new perspectives for progress in Sudan and for the reduction of poverty in line with the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda,” said Mr. Jazairy. “It will also contribute to the stability of the whole region and restore the country’s potential to become the breadbasket of north-east Africa.”
