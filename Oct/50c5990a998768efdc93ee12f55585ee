                        Nowhere in the world today are children more central to a continent's future than in Africa, where they account for almost half of all inhabitants. The surge in Africa's child population mirrors the rise in the continent’s overall population, which itself is set to more than double, reaching 2.5 billion by 2050.
 

Demographic transitions of this magnitude present both opportunities and challenges. The opportunity for Africa lies in the vast potential of its current and future generations of children and youth. Investing in their health, protection, and education can result in a demographic dividend in the 21st century that could lift hundreds of millions of Africans out of extreme poverty, and contribute to enhanced prosperity, stability and peace on the continent and beyond.

To learn more about implications and opportunities relating to this unprecedented shift in Africa’s child populations, you are invited to the launch of the Generation 2030 2.0 report on:
