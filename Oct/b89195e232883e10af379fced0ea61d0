CAIRO, Egypt, October 24, 2017/APO Group/ -- 
                                                
                        The U.S. Embassy is pleased to announce the launch of “Shaghlna,” a new series of job fairs for job-seekers across the country that builds on the success of employment fairs held over the past three years in Cairo.





The Shaghlna program includes three upcoming employment fairs, sponsored by the U.S. Embassy. The first will take place at the Helnan Hotel in Aswan on November 17. The second fair will be held in Cairo in March 2018 and the third will be held in Alexandria in April 2018.
                            These fairs are part of our continued support for Egyptian economic growth and job creation, and demonstrate our commitment to the continued economic development of Egypt
                        



According to Chargé d’Affaires of the U.S. Embassy in Cairo Thomas Goldberger, “The United States wants to be a partner to Egypt and the Egyptian people, and one of the ways we can do that is through helping to match up the talented Egyptian workforce with local and international companies. These fairs are part of our continued support for Egyptian economic growth and job creation, and demonstrate our commitment to the continued economic development of Egypt.”



Each employment fair will feature companies with hundreds of verified job vacancies, and will also provide job-seekers with professional development and training sessions throughout the day. In past years, thousands of Egyptian job applicants found employment as a result of these fairs.



The employment fairs are free and registration is open to the public. Please see https://www.facebook.com/shaghlna/ for registration information.
