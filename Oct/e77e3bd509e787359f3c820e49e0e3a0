                        The United States Ambassador to the United Nations has demanded greater progress towards peace in South Sudan during a flying visit to the country’s capital Juba. Ambassador Nikki Haley visited the United Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) and saw first-hand the challenges faced by the 33,000 people sheltering from ongoing violence in the nearby Protection of Civilians site. She also met with the President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir, and had what she described as a “very frank” conversation about the lack of progress towards peace since civil war broke out almost four years ago. “I didn’t come here to talk. I came here to say the time for action is now. We are not waiting anymore we need to see a change and we need to see it right away,” she said. “We have lost trust in this Government and we now need to regain that trust. The only way to regain that trust is through the actions of taking care of all of the people. President Kiir is the president of everyone, not just one tribe, not just one group. In order to be a leader you have to be willing to take care of all of your people.”
