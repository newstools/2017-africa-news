                        Foreign Office Minister, Tobias Ellwood, said:



"I am deeply concerned by the decision of the Government of Egypt’s closure of the Nadeem Centre for Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence, a prominent Egyptian human rights defender."

"At a time when there are widespread concerns about torture and abuse in detention in Egypt, shutting down the Egyptian voices calling for accountability and transparency is a step in the wrong direction. The protection of all Egyptians by accountable institutions operating under the rule of law is fundamental to Egypt’s security and stability."
