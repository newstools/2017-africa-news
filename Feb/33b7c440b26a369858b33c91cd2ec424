NEW YORK, United States of America, February 17, 2017/APO/ --
                                                
                        On 10 February, the Permanent Mission of the Republic of The Gambia to the United Nations delivered to the Secretary-General notification of the country’s rescission of its withdrawal from the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.

The Gambia had formally notified the Secretary-General of its withdrawal from the Rome Statute on 10 November 2016 — a decision which the Secretary-General deeply regretted.

Over the past two decades, the world has made decisive strides towards building a truly global system of international criminal justice, of which the ICC is its centrepiece.  

The Gambia, like so many other African States, played a major role in the negotiations leading to the adoption of the Rome Statute and was among its first signatories.  

The Secretary-General welcomes that The Gambia will remain a State Party to the International Criminal Court’s founding instrument, and remains confident that States Parties will continue to further strengthen the Court through a constructive dialogue.
