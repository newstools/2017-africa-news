ATHENS, Greece, February 17, 2017/APO/ --
                                                
                        Deputy Foreign Minister Terens-Nikolaos Quick met at the Foreign Ministry today with the honorary Consul of Botswana in Greece, Nektarios Polychroniou, and was briefed on special issues concerning Botswana and on the Greek community living and working there.



The meeting was held in the context of preparations for the visits the Deputy Foreign Minister is scheduling to select countries of sub-Saharan Africa -- some of which have never before been visited by a member of the Greek government -- with which it is deemed that there is room for strengthening of bilateral political and economic relations.
