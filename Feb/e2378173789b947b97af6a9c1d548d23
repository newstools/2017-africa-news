“On this sad and painful occasion, I express, on my own behalf and that of the United Nations system in the DRC, my deep and sincere condolences to the family of the deceased, the government of the DRC, and the Congolese population as a whole, and I salute his important contribution to the promotion of democracy in the DRC,” Maman S.
