The report encourages African countries to harness the dynamism of the tourism sector, which has been praised for its capacity to stimulate economic growth and create jobs by attracting investment and fostering entrepreneurship. If properly harnessed, tourism can also contribute towards preserving ecosystems and biodiversity, protecting cultural heritage and promoting empowerment of local communities. The United Nations designated 2017 as the International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development.
